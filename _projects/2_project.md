Othello is a pretty simple game. It consists of a 8x8 square board, and pieces with one black and one white side. Each player has a color, and the aim of the game is to get more of your pieces on the board than the opponent's pieces.

My project of Fundamentals of Computer is Othello with c language.

This game is also a board game.
