`Mathematical` equations offer unique windows into the world. They make sense of reality and help us see things that haven't been previously noticed. So itâ€™s no surprise that new developments in math have often gone hand in hand with advancements in our understanding of the universe.

Here, we take a look at one equation from history that have revolutionized how we look at everything from tiny particles to the vast cosmos.

$$
x(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} t \cdot e^{-i2\pi ft} dt
$$

Even if you haven't heard of the French baron Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, his work has affected your life. That's because the mathematical equations he wrote down in 1822 have allowed researchers to break down complex and messy data into combinations of simple waves that are much easier to analyze. The Fourier transform, as it's known, was a radical notion in its time, with many scientists refusing to believe that intricate systems could be reduced to such elegant simplicity, according to an article in Yale Scientific. But Fourier transforms are the workhorses in many modern fields of science, including data processing, image analysis, optics, communication, astronomy and engineering.
