The relationship between mathematics and physics has been a subject of study of philosophers, mathematicians and physicists since antiquity, and more recently also by historians and educators. Generally considered a relationship of great intimacy, mathematics has been described as an essential tool for physics and physics has been described as a rich source of inspiration and insight in mathematics.

Here, I take a example of this relationship:

$$
    {J(\theta) =\frac{1}{2m} [\sum^m_{i=1}(h_\theta(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})2 + \lambda\sum^n_{j=1}\theta^2_j}
$$
