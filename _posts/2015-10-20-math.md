The relationship between mathematics and physics has been a subject of study of philosophers, mathematicians and physicists since antiquity, and more recently also by historians and educators. Generally considered a relationship of great intimacy, mathematics has been described as an essential tool for physics and physics has been described as a rich source of inspiration and insight in mathematics.

Here, I take a example of this relationship:

$$
    V &= \iiint \rho^{2} sin{\theta} d\rho d\theta d\varphi \\
    &= \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{r} \rho^{2} \sin{\theta} d\rho d\theta d\varphi \\
    &= 2\pi \int_{0}^{\pi} \int_{0}^{r} \rho^{2} \sin{\theta} d\rho d\theta \\
    &= 4\pi \int_{0}^{r} \rho^{2} d\rho \\
    &= \frac{4\pi}{3}\rho^{3}
$$
